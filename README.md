# Whole Sort Of General Mish Mash

Maybe this project would be more aptly named a
[MeltingPot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot) or a
[SaladBowl]"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salad_bowl_(cultural_idea)" or
something?  I decided to call it a 
[Whole Sort Of General Mish Mash](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Whole_Sort_of_General_Mish_Mash)
after the concept in 
[Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchikers_guide_to_the_galaxy)
because actually it's just an arrangement of not-so-random stuff I've coded up 
which has probably already been coded elsewhere in the Universe, by others, 
using better syntax.  It depends on how you look at it.  Probably.

Enjoye!

# Whole Sort Of General Mish Mash

Maybe this project would be more aptly named a [Melting Pot][1] or a [Salad 
Bowl][2] or something?  I decided to call it a [Whole Sort Of General Mish 
Mash][3] after the concept in [Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy][4] because
actually this project is just an arrangement of not-so-random stuff that I've
coded up over the years, which have probably already been coded up elsewhere in 
the Universe, by others, using better syntax and pink highlighters.  It depends
on how you look at it.  Probably.

Enjoye! ;)
